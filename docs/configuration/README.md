# Configuration

### Theme
Slides allows you to customize your presentation's theme.

In your `presentation.md` file prepend the following configuration.
```yaml
---
theme: dark
---
```

`theme` can be any one of the following:
* `dark`
* `light`
* `ascii`
* `notty`
* `./theme.json`

You can pass a path to a `JSON` file that specifies your theme.
Check out the default [theme.json](../../styles/theme.json) to use as a base for your custom theme.
